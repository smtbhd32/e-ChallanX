# EchallanX: Simplifying Payment of Traffic Challans

## Introduction:
EchallanX is a digital solution aimed at addressing the low payment rates for e-challans generated for traffic violations. The current process is often cumbersome and involves physically visiting a traffic police station or paying at a bank, leading to a low payment rate of around 30-35%. Our aim is to improve this rate by providing a user-friendly interface for people to view their outstanding challans, pay them online, and challenge them if necessary.

## Approach:
The proposed solution involves creating a unique e-challan ID for every driver linked to their driving license. All the outstanding challans for that driver will be recorded on their unique ID, which will need to be renewed every six months. Failure to renew the ID will result in the driver not being able to access other services such as pollution certificates and license renewal.

Issuing of challans will be done using AI cameras and traffic police, with all issued challans being loaded onto a centralized server. Once issued, violators will be informed about their e-challan and due dates via SMS, emails, and IVR calls. They will have a fixed time period for challenging the challan and paying the fine. After this period, a heavy fine will be levied, and if the challan remains unpaid, the driver's e-challan ID will not be renewed, and they will not be able to access other services.
